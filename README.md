# c-practice
playground for learning the intricacies I've previously avoided of the C(and C++) language.

Somewhat based on the book [**Advanced C and C++ Compiling**](https://doc.lagout.org/programmation/C/Advanced%20C%20and%20C%20%20%20Compiling%20%5BStevanovic%202014-04-28%5D.pdf) by Milan Stevanovic

The directories that begin with numbers indicate the chapters in the book. They contain program samples from the book, and also some more stuff I found relevant.


# what's the deal with `chmod`??
`$ chmod +x ????`

# gcc

# header file
